Software produced at Plyint will typically be released under a proprietary commercial license, but will have it's source code made available publicly.  The proprietary commercial license will carry conditions specifying how the software can be used under an [OSI approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses).  Typically this means removing proprietary trademarks (e.g. Our company name "Plyint" or product brand names from the code) before distribution.  

Plyint follows the [*"Free Software Product"*](https://sfosc.org/docs/business-models/free-software-product/) business model as described by the SFOSC (Sustainable Free and Open Source Community). Plyint is not encharge of any community derived open source versions of its products and does not provide support for those derivative versions.  It is expected that **the community owns and supports** any open source derivative.

In addition to our commercial products, Plyint will also release software directly under OSI approved open source licenses from time to time.  These may be internal tools that we developed as part of other projects or pure open source ventures on their own.  Plyint will provide support for these tools on best effort basis and will be encharge of the corresponding open source repositories.
